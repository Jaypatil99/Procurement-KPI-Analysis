# Procurement KPI 

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project evaluates procurement operations for a global enterprise by analyzing **purchase order (PO) compliance, approval efficiency, supplier performance, and spend distribution**. The goal is to identify process bottlenecks, risks, and opportunities for cost optimization.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Measure **PO compliance** with organizational policies.  
- Track **approval and resolution efficiency**.  
- Highlight **red-flag POs** (high-value or delayed).  
- Assess **supplier performance** using on-time delivery and defect rates.  
- Provide an **interactive dashboard** for managers to monitor procurement health.  

## 📊 Key KPIs  
- **PO Compliance %** → % of POs approved as per policy.  
- **Average Resolution Days** → Efficiency of resolving purchase orders.  
- **% of Red-Flag POs** → High-risk or delayed orders.  
- **Spend Under Management** → Controlled vs. uncontrolled spend.  
- **Supplier Performance Metrics** → On-time delivery rate, defect rate, cost variance.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** → Data cleaning, KPI calculation, exploratory analysis.  
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Analysis & visualization.  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard design.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights  
- **Bar Chart** → Compliance % by department/region.  
- **Line Chart** → Resolution time trends across months.  
- **Table** → Red-flag POs for managerial action.  
- **Pie Chart** → Spend distribution across suppliers.  

## 🔑 Insights  
- Departments with **low compliance** may require training or enforcement.  
- **Red-flag POs** highlight potential financial/operational risks.  
- **Resolution delays** indicate bottlenecks in approval workflows.  
- Supplier analysis reveals top vs. underperforming vendors.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Automate PO approval reminders.  
- Audit high-value delayed POs.  
- Standardize supplier performance reviews.
